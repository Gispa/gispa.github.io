### Hey there, I'm Gispa! üëãüèæ
I'm a Victoria based technical learning (TL) SOC analyst intern with CyberLynk, where I am training to build and support a secure future for Australian organisations.

This site is where I document my personal IT projects, post how-tos and blog about cyber security. It's currently mostly focused on SOC infrastructure and operations, but occasionally I will branch out into other areas of interest. Take a look around, check out my [projects](https://gispa.github.io/projects), or read my [blog posts](https://gispa.github.io)! This site is a new project and a work-in-progress, so there's still plenty more to come.

A little bit more about me. Since making the switch from a career in acting, production, and retail, I have gained a Cert IV in Cyber Security from Melbourne Polytechnic, and I aim to complete my Blue Team Level 1 Certification in early July (I'm over halfway as of writing). I love building out homelabs and emulating security infrastructure in EVE-NG, and when I'm not on the keyboard I enjoy playing with my kelpie, tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs), and futsal. I also dabble in game design for [A Dance of Ribbons](https://comeandlisten.com.au/a-dance-of-ribbons/), a narrative-driven LARP that I work with a team to design mechanics for!

Thanks for visiting, I hope you enjoy your time in this slice of the net üíñ
